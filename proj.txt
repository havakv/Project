Want to look at:

Framework
- Cross validation
- EPE (Expected prediction error)
- Deviance
- Regularization (logistic, anyone else?)
- Bayes Classifier
- Bootstrap
- NOT Kernel?

Methods
- Logistic regression
- LDA (QDA, RDA)
- Trees (CART, bagging, RF, Boosting)
- Neural Nets (and deep nural nets)

Other methods?
- k-NN
- SVM's
- Projection pursuit regression (to introduce neural networks?)
